 #   Binomial Distribution Package
 #   Overview

    This package provides a class to represent and work with a binomial distribution, a type of probability distribution that describes the number of successes in a fixed number of independent trials, each with the same probability of success. The package also includes methods to calculate important statistical properties, such as the mean and standard deviation, and to update these based on a dataset.

  # Features
    Calculate Binomial Distribution Statistics: Calculate the mean, standard deviation, and other properties of a binomial distribution.
    Load Data from File: Read a dataset from a file and update the binomial distribution's parameters (n, p, mean, stdev).
    Plotting: Visualize the binomial distribution using various plotting methods.
    Integration with General Distribution Class: Inherits from a general distribution class that provides shared functionality.
    Installation
  #  To install the package, use pip:

    pip install your-package-name
    If the package is not yet available on PyPI, you can install it directly from the source:

    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git
    cd your-repository
    python setup.py install

    Usage
   # 1. Import the Package

    from binomial_distribution import BinomialDistribution

   # 2. Create a Binomial Distribution Object

    binom_dist = BinomialDistribution(p=0.5, n=20)

   # 3. Update Statistics from a Dataset

    Assume you have a file data.txt containing a list of 0s and 1s:
    binom_dist.replace_stats_with_data()

   # 4. Access Distribution Properties
    print(f"Mean: {binom_dist.mean}")
    print(f"Standard Deviation: {binom_dist.stdev}")
   # 5. Plotting

    Visualize the distribution:

    binom_dist.plot_bar()
    Example:
    from binomial_distribution import BinomialDistribution

# Create a binomial distribution with 10 trials and probability of success 0.3
    binom_dist = BinomialDistribution(p=0.3, n=10)

# Read data from a file and update statistics
    binom_dist.replace_stats_with_data()

# Print the updated mean and standard deviation
    print(f"Updated Mean: {binom_dist.mean}")
    print(f"Updated Standard Deviation: {binom_dist.stdev}")

# Plot the distribution
    binom_dist.plot_bar()
    Testing
# To run the tests for this package, use:
